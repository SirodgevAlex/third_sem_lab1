Doctor’s advise.
	The nurse asked me if waited for Dr. Grey and invited me to his surgery.
	Dr. Grey asked me what was bothering me. I said that I am terribly ran down. He asked me if I was staying up late, and I said yes. Then he asked why I am not keeping regular hours, and I explained that almost every evening I meet with friends. The doctor wanted to know how I spend my time and I said that I mostly go to parties. The Doctor asked me If I had a chance to recover on the weekend, but I had to admit, that on weekends our parties last all nights.
	he asked me, If I smoking and when I said yes, the doctor wanted to know how many cigarettes do I smoke a day. He was amazed, when he heard my answer. Then the doctor asked me if I was taking gymnastics lessons to keeping fit.
	I answered, that I have not time for this.
	You lights a candle at both sides - Dr. Grey said and added - but I envy you, that you are having so much fun.
